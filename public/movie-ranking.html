<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This movie is just incredibly nostalgic for me. 
    I first watched it when I was very little and the music and story have stuck with me ever since.</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
<p>When I was 8, the Pirates of the Caribbean series helped me discover my obsession with pirates. 
    Not to mention that Jack Sparrow is just absolutely hilarious in this movie. </p>
<h3>Monsters University</h3>
<p>As a college student who is constantly worried about the future, this movie always brings me comfort.
    SPOILERS: I appreciate how in the end, even though they got expelled, they were still able to find a path to their dream careers. </p>
<h3>YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN</h3>
<p>Gene Wilder. Need I say more?</p>
